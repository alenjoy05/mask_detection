# 😷 Face Mask Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to detect whether a person is **wearing a face mask or not**. The model is trained on image datasets of people **with masks** and **without masks**, and can be integrated into real-time applications such as surveillance systems, healthcare monitoring, and workplace safety compliance.

## ✨ Features

* 🧠 **Deep Learning Model:** CNN trained to classify images as *Mask* or *No Mask*.
* 📊 **High Accuracy:** Optimized through data augmentation and dropout to prevent overfitting.
* 🎥 **Real-time Detection:** Can be extended to webcam/live feed applications.
* 📂 **Dataset Support:** Works with custom datasets or public datasets (e.g., Kaggle).
* 🔔 **Practical Use Case:** Helps ensure compliance with safety measures in public spaces.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Libraries:** NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
* **Dataset:** Images of people with and without face masks
